             Our project is the simulation of a flexible string modelled as
    point masses connected by springs and other objects modelled as point
    masses.  The user will be able to interact with the other objects by
    'grabbing' them with the string.  The visual display will be on pxpl4,
    and the force display will go back through the arm.  The other objects
    will be constrained by walls around the environment, from which they
    will rebound.

             There are basically three parts to this project.  The first
    part is an interface to the force-feedback arm as an input and output
    device.  The second part is the simulation of the motion of objects.
    The third part is the display of objects on pxpl4.  The first part is
    provided by my work with GRIP.  The third part will be done by Phil.
    The second part will be split between Phil and I.

             I will be working on the simulation of the string and the
    motion of the masses in the environment.  Phil will be doing most of
    the work on simulating other forces in the environment, including the
    boundary conditions.

             Phil will be writing a display server for pxpl4 so that we can
    run this simulation on another machine.  There exists a server for the
    arm so we do not have to run it on glycine.  The existence of both
    servers will mean that input, computation, and output can be done on
    separate machines, hopefully increasing performance.  We plan to test
    this on different machine configurations to find the fastest
    combination.
