<p>The <i>WebSlinger</i> program simulates meshes of nodes (masses) connected 
  by (linear and non-linear) springs. It enables mouse-based interaction and saving 
  of node positions during pulling.</p>
<h2>Configuration File</h2>
<p>When the program is run, it will open a configuration file to determine the 
  structure and parameters of the structure to simulate. The default name for 
  this file is <i>webslinger.cfg</i> and its default location is the directory 
  where the program was run. You can specify a different configuration file by 
  running on the command line or by dragging the configuration file and dropping 
  it onto the <i>WebSlinger</i> program.</p>
<p>The format of the configuration file is shown below. All lines between the 
  <i>structure {</i> opening line and the <i>}</i> final line are optional, and 
  each optional line can appear more than once.</p>

<p>The <i>mass_damping</i>, <i>mass_radius</i>, <i>spring_constant_over_length</i>, 
  and <i>rest_length_fraction</i> lines are parameters that apply to all following 
  masses or springs. They can be interleaved between mass and spring definitions 
  to result in different types of masses and springs in the same structure. The 
  object to which they apply and their default values is shown in the table below:</p>

<p>The <b><i>mass_radius</i></b> parameter specifies the displayed radius of all 
  following masses in pixels. This does not affect the solutions to the simulation; 
  it is only there to help visualize the web. One approach is to put larger-radius 
  masses with very large values (1e100) as fixed end-points for webs and smaller-radius 
  masses at the nodes to make it clear where the mouse can grab the web.</p>
<p>The <b><i>mass_damping</i></b> parameter specifies how much damping is applied 
  during the simulation of all following masses. It is the force per unit velocity 
  that opposed motion. Velocity is in pixels/frame.</p>
<p>The <b><i>rest_length_fraction</i></b> parameter is used to compute the rest 
  length of all following springs that do not have their rest length defined. 
  This is a unitless parameter that indicates that the rest length of the spring 
  is computed by taking the initial distance between the two masses and multiplying 
  it by <i>rest_length_fraction</i> to find the rest length of the spring. For 
  instance, a value of 1.0 (the default) makes the rest length equal to the initial 
  length, whereas a value of 0.5 makes the rest length half of the initial length 
  (the spring is initially under tension).</p>
<p>The <b><i>spring_const_over_length</i></b> parameter is used to calculate the 
  spring constant of following linear springs whose spring constant is not defined 
  in the file (the first spring option only takes the names of the two masses 
  it is connected to). If a spring's spring constant is not specified, then it 
  is computed as <i>spring_const_over_length / rest_length</i>. When applied to 
  the <i>general_spring</i> class, this becomes the spring constant without being 
  divided by the length (because the <i>general_spring</i> class maps strain to 
  force, and strain is intrinsically independent of length.</p>
<p>The <b><i>general_strain_force_curve</i></b> specifies the mapping between 
  strain and force for the <i>generic_spring</i> class. The force curve is given 
  a name than can then be referred to. Note that you probably want the force to 
  be 0.0 at a strain of 1.0 (rest length). Note also that at larger strains, you 
  should probably subtract one from the strain value when computing the force 
  (to take into account the fact that a strain of 1 is rest length).</p>
<p>The <b><i>step_and_save</i></b> entry will cause the program to go through 
  an automatic simulation sequence when it starts up. It will run <i>COUNT</i> 
  simulations steps to let things settle, then save to file <i>NAME</i> the masses. 
  It will then move the specified mass <i>NAME1</i> by the number of pixels specified 
  in <i>DX</i>, <i>DY</i> and do this again. This is repeated for <i>NUM_STEPS</i> 
  times, and then the simulation enters interactive mode. All <i>follow_mass</i> 
  entries will be moved by the same trajectory as the original mass.</p>

<h2>Output File</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Version History</h2>
<h3>Version 4.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This version modifies the step-and-save syntax and enables the masses to 
    move in different trajectories.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Version 3.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This version enables more than one mass to be moved along the same trajectory.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Version 3.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This version stores the force acting on each mass along with the trajectory.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Version 2.4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This version adds the ability to describe a step-and-save trajectory where 
    one of the masses is moved by a fixed amount between steps and then the results 
    are saved into an output file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.3</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Major</i></b> bug fix -- the earlier versions were computing the forces 
    quadratically for the springs, not linearly. This version has the <i>spring</i> 
    primitive behaving linearly.</li>
  <li>This version adds the ability to insert a <i>general_spring</i>, so non-linear 
    springs can be inserted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 2.2</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is the first released version of the program. It includes the ability 
    to open different configuration files and to save the positions of the nodes 
    in an output file.</li>
</ul>
